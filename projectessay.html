                <p>The coronavirus that has begun in December 2019 has spread all over the world. The impact of this virus is devastating, as it would damage almost everything in the world. Our situation would be much better when we all coordinate with the government. However, this is not possible as there are stubborn humans that are fed with misinformation. How would we stop the spread? </p>

                <p>We could stop the spread of the virus by killing the ones infected by it. If they are dead, they cannot move around the world and spread it to other people. Our way to find out who is infected by it and who isn't is by mass testing. We will bring the infected into our facilities. If they resist our abduction, we will knock them out, tie them up, and transfer their body to our facilities. Our method of putting people to rest is simple. We would administer a lethal dose of Potassium Chloride. This should be able to end people in pain. If they manage to survive the dose, we will put them in a different room with Carbon Monoxide and wait until they die. We would know if they are dead by simply checking their pulse, and if there is no sign of a beating heart, we will bring them to the last location. This location is a crematorium where we will cremate their body into ashes. These ashes will be properly disposed of, so there will be less risk of it getting transmitted.</p>

                <p>We have to make some sacrifices for humanity, and we must be willing to accept it. This is all for our future, and the next generations would thank us.</p>
